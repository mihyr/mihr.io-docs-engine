# mihr.io Projects Docs Engine

My forked version of cloudflareâ€™s open-source tool for building project documentation.

Please visit [http://docs.mihr.io/](http://docs.mihr.io/) for more details on how to use this docs engine.

Steps to automate the process using github workflow and cloudflare worker can be found in my website repo [mihyr/mihr.io](https://github.com/mihyr/mihr.io)
